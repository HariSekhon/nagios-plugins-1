==============
:doctype: manpage  


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This repository contains various Nagios plugins that I've written over
time. These are all available under the same license (see the LICENSE
file). They cover a range of functions and you probably won't need all
of them, but hopefully some of them will be useful.

If it turns out that you do like and use these, please drop me an email
at mark@qq.is and just let me know. It's purely voluntary but it's
always good to hear that people are finding things useful.


BUGS
----
None known. They certainly exist. Please submit bug reports -- you can
use GitHub here or you can email me.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
----------------
Most of these have been written while woking for StumbleUpon and
Bump Technologies, two great companies that both support open source
development and have been kind enough to allow me to release these
tools.
